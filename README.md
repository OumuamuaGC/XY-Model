# XY-Model

This is for the final project of the course Statistical Mechanics.
Monte Carlo simulations for 2D XY model of square lattice with Metropolis algorithm.
The project is coded with cpp for high-efficiency simulations.

# Instructions

Files inside directory "critical" are used to output how thermodynamics quantities vary with temperature, which can yield critical exponents by fitting the data points.  
Files inside directory "exfield" are used to demonstrate how the magnetization varies with external magnetic field under different temperatures.
When running the program, one should input two arguments which are the size of the grid and the number of Monte Carlo steps.
