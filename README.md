# XY-Model

This is the final project for the course Statistical Mechanics.

Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis algorithm for 2D XY model of square lattice.

The project is coded with c++ to achieve high-efficiency simulation.

# Instructions

Files inside the directory "critical" are used to output how thermodynamics quantities vary with temperature, which can yield critical exponents by fitting those data points.  

Files inside the directory "exfield" are used to demonstrate how the magnetization varies with external magnetic field at different temperatures.

When running the program, one should input two arguments which are the size of the grid and the number of Monte Carlo steps.
